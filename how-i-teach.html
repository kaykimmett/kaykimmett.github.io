<h4>How does tuition work?</h4>

<p>The way students are examined has become more challenging and performance expectations are incredibly high. Lots of different skills can raise test scores but one of the most important is improving students’ reading skills.</p>
<p>The new English curriculum emphasises that “reading” still needs to be taught as a generic skill. However older texts need to be “read” as historical documents in order to access the writers’ ideas. Here knowledge gaps can turn into a bit of a lottery as students’ accumulated background knowledge varies.  For example those who appreciate scientific orthodoxy of 1818 and the gothic literary genre, will be able to access different and deeper layers of meaning in Shelleys’ Frankenstein. This prior knowledge compliments what the AQA exam board would call assessment objective A01 – (the text’s ideas).</p>
<p>Students often miss the higher mark bands because even though they are good at A02 (explaining and analysing individual language choices) they are weaker on complex ideas (A01) and how these ideas interact with one another.</p>
<p>Although texts can be challenging, with constant one to one reassurance and encouragement, students can access this surface knowledge and blend the two reading skills together.</p>

<h4>How can my child avoid underachieving?</h4>

<p>Good tuition should also be data minded and work with the students’ performance targets and levels of attainment from their English faculty. Here it is useful to use a tutor who has “hands on” classroom experience. Not just to be responsive to knowledge gaps but to have a collective knowledge grounded in the realities of real schools i.e. knowing that you need to teach and what you can for now ignore!</p>
<p>Classroom situations are an inevitable trade off between breadth and depth, as there are group needs to consider.  With one to one tuition it is much easier to tailor content to individual students and help students remember what they learn.</p>

<h4>Can you do my work for me?</h4>
<p>An occasional question – the short answer is “no” but I can help make what you’ve written yourself amazing!</p>

<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>Many other curriculum subjects depend on high levels of fluency and technical accuracy in grammar, vocabulary and punctuation. When students engage in a fluent way within the printed and digital worlds they will be in future demand – from employers, Universities and others in today’s globalised economy.</p>

<h4>Revision tips – help or hindrance?</h4>
<p>The latest thinking on how memory works argues that many favourite revision techniques (highlighting, summarising, mnemonics and visualising) don’t necessarily lead to exam success. All of the former act as safety blankets and can be useful but the three listed below come highly recommended.</p>
<p><b>Self quizzing</b> to check knowledge, especially using <i>flash cards</i> is rated extremely highly.</p>
<p>A little “deliberate difficulty” helps too. So re-read a text, <i>revisit</i> the critical concepts and test yourself or try ‘Just a Minute’ (copied from the classic radio game). Talk for a minute on a topic – no pauses, no hesitations. Slips or repetitions or micro pauses lose a ‘life’ – three strikes and you’re out. If you can do this, you have retrieved this knowledge from memory – a good revision act – as well as consolidating it too.</p>
<p><b>Spreading the load</b>. Cramming is counter productive: studying little and often will help ideas stick. Short targeted bursts work, especially with practice past questions. If these are not well spaced over time, students become snowed under with detail and not able to write their best response.</p>
<p>Variety helps too, for example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Switch between different kinds of problems (this is called interleaved practice) so for example chart the trajectories of love and hate in Romeo and Juliet (macro). Then select say six of the anthology poems and analyse onomatopoeic phrases (micro).</li>
    <li>Reformat the knowledge. Graphic/knowledge organisers help students become active in their own revision, (not just reading their notes and doing some colouring in with a rainbow of highlighters).</li>
</ol>
<p>Using say a spider map students can ‘select’ the most important ideas from a given topic. This is active revision rather than simply re-reading or using mnemonics.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions with detailed feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSE English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>A Level English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>The Common Entrance 11+, 13 or scholarship papers</li>
</ul>

<h4>How much do you charge for a lesson?</h4>
<p>I charge <b>£25</b> for a <b>60</b> minute lesson up to GCSE, and <b>£35</b> for A Level.</p>
