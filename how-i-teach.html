Choosing the right tuition can often feel like looking for a needle in a haystack.  It is a flourishing business (roughly a quarter of GCSE students are tutored).  Ironically there are now so many agencies and “study centres” the more you hunt, search and deliberate the more they start to look the same and you’re left just hoping you make the right call.  

<h4>Is tuition a good investment?</h4>
<p>It is not about gaining an unfair advantage over classmates or undervaluing what schools do.  Not at all.  Most parents simply want to see their children reach their potential.  Certainly help (or “intervention” in edu speak) is much more beneficial at the beginning of say a GCSE course than towards the end.</p>

<h4>How does tuition differ from school?</h4>
<p>Like a Venn diagram there are lots of overlaps.   Schools often set really clear goals; it is important to know the student’s targets,  but one to one tuition is more responsive.  Identifying what they have understood and where they are struggling is much easier individually, than in say a class of 30 students.</p>
<p>Some students are very engaged with English as a subject but reach badly to say a chop and change of school staff , and so underachieve.  Assessing prior knowledge and filling in the gaps is crucial when I first meet a new student.  It is not just about giving them information.  You need to be strategic.  </p>
<p>Most students are not aware of what these knowledge gaps are and it’s only human to avoid areas we feel less confident in.  Similar to schools I use knowledge organisers and ideas like cognitive load theory to embed ideas.  A deep knowledge of the exam boards’ mark schemes is crucial.  I try to keep things interesting with different formats; digital resources are really useful but often printed resources are more challenging  (educational publishers get higher margins on these.)</p>

<h4>Will tuition increase my child’s confidence?</h4>
<p>Study centres keep costs down by applying a tested format to group situations while reassuring parents that they are “caring and “encouraging”; they have their place in educational attainment.    A good rapport between student and tutor is much easier on a one to one basis.  Building confidence is a longer term aim which grows organically from your student getting better marks.  A deep knowledge of the exam boards’ mark schemes and how to apply these, is how to get students to flourish.</p>

<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>Many other curriculum subjects depend on high levels of fluency and technical accuracy in grammar, vocabulary and punctuation. When students engage in a fluent way within the printed and digital worlds they will be in future demand – from employers, Universities and others in today’s globalised economy.</p>

<h4>Revision tips – help or hindrance?</h4>
<p>The latest thinking on how memory works argues that many favourite revision techniques (highlighting, summarising, mnemonics and visualising) don’t necessarily lead to exam success. All of the former act as safety blankets and can be useful but the three listed below come highly recommended.</p>
<p><b>Self quizzing</b> to check knowledge, especially using <i>flash cards</i> is rated extremely highly.</p>
<p>A little “deliberate difficulty” helps too. So re-read a text, <i>revisit</i> the critical concepts and test yourself or try ‘Just a Minute’ (copied from the classic radio game). Talk for a minute on a topic – no pauses, no hesitations. Slips or repetitions or micro pauses lose a ‘life’ – three strikes and you’re out. If you can do this, you have retrieved this knowledge from memory – a good revision act – as well as consolidating it too.</p>
<p><b>Spreading the load</b>. Cramming is counter productive: studying little and often will help ideas stick. Short targeted bursts work, especially with practice past questions. If these are not well spaced over time, students become snowed under with detail and not able to write their best response.</p>
<p>Variety helps too, for example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Switch between different kinds of problems (this is called interleaved practice) so for example chart the trajectories of love and hate in Romeo and Juliet (macro). Then select say six of the anthology poems and analyse onomatopoeic phrases (micro).</li>
    <li>Reformat the knowledge. Graphic/knowledge organisers help students become active in their own revision, (not just reading their notes and doing some colouring in with a rainbow of highlighters).</li>
</ol>
<p>Using say a spider map students can ‘select’ the most important ideas from a given topic. This is active revision rather than simply re-reading or using mnemonics.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions with detailed feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSE English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>A Level English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>The Common Entrance 11+, 13 or scholarship papers</li>
</ul>

<h4>How much do you charge for a lesson?</h4>
<p>I charge <b>£25</b> for a <b>60</b> minute lesson up to GCSE, and <b>£35</b> for A Level.</p>
