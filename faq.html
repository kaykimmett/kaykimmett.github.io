<h4>Why should I use your services?</h4>

<p>Teaching materials should be challenging enough to engage students but not so challenging that they want to give up; it can be difficult to achieve this in today’s mixed ability, busy classrooms.  Neither is “aptitude” the sole determinant of exam success. It is difficult to overstate the benefits of reading widely, but even the keenest readers can struggle to see the value of 19th century fictional texts.  For others they can be simply frustrating to access, as so much of the meaning is context dependent. I teach new knowledge within a clear conceptual framework – not in isolation, so students begin to view older texts with less anxiety.</p>
<p>Demystifying the opaque criteria of mark schemes is also vital. For example top grades in English Literature were previously awarded based on words such as ‘originality’ and ‘flair’ (AQA 2014) These have been replaced with the new Level 6 terms ‘convincing, critical analysis and exploration’ (AQA 2017 ).”  Without clear examples to illustrate what these criteria mean in practice, students have no clear path forwards and they remain abstract concepts, rather than something they can engage with.</p>
<p>Another precursor of creativity and knowledge is grammar, a dry subject which lacks emotional associations for student but nevertheless the bedrock of any writing.  I prioritise any knowledge gaps there to begin with.  Some students underestimate their own writing ability, some need more structure, and for others deeper understanding is achieved via another route.</p>
<p>In reality if students are simply exposed to an avalanche of good writing this will not produce a top mark either.  We write in a variety of formats, varying in length, formality and permanance but the exam boards require competent writers who tailor their language to the demands of the medium. This is an area of tuition where students often need most support or they miss out on cross curricular educational windfalls.</p>
<p>Closing vocabulary gaps is another key stepping stone to success, as well as breaking concepts down into useable chunks. However to gain a really complex reading response from a student “problem posing” as well as a “problem solving” yields results. My students can then extend what they already know, as well as develop deeper learning on the topic in hand.</p>
<p>Organising your own thoughts, so that they may be communicated clearly to others is an important English skill and 1:1 discussions really enhance this competance.  A student who knows some historical chronology about say a Shakesperian text, will inevitably unearth more meaning. Similarly, if a student only knows what a simile and metaphor are they will be more limited than one who has been taught wider techniques. Although generic textbooks, apps and podcasts all have their own place as learning tools, sometimes sole focus on the text itself can yield huge benefits. Peeling back the layers of meaning helps unearth more complexity, nuances and leads students into the area of “critical analysis” so valued by examination boards.</p>
<p>Being clear, encouraging and building a good rapport with students begins with the idea that making mistakes is an important element in the learning process. Most students all share a common trait – they want to do well in this awesome subject!</p>


<h4>Can you do my work for me?</h4>
<p>Sadly I cannot write essays for you. Students do ask this now and again and while I like to help in any way I can, writing other people’s essays is not a good idea. However I am happy to offer sessions on study skills and help make what you’ve written yourself, amazing!</p>

<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>As well as being a core subject, English skills are valued by both employers and Universities. The ability to work in a globalised economy requires young people to engage in a fluent way with the printed and digital worlds. Nearly 1 in 4 teenagers in the UK have received private or home tuition at some point, according to recent IPSOS Mori research. It is a flexible way to improve both grades and confidence. Although English is at the heart of the curriculum, many other subjects depend on high levels of fluency and technical accuracy in grammar, vocabulary and punctuation.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions with detailed feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSE English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>A Level English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>The Common Entrance 11+, 13 or scholarship papers</li>
</ul>

<h4>How much do you charge for a lesson?</h4>
<p>I charge <b>£25</b> for a <b>60</b> minute lesson up to GCSE, and <b>£35</b> for A Level.</p>

<h4>Why is reading important?</h4>
<p>Being a fluent reader is central to making academic progress at school. It is also a requirement for children who want a place at selective local private schools. Some organisations such as the National Literacy Trust and the OECD claim that reading for pleasure at the age of 15 is a strong factor in determining the future success of the child. Analysis so far of the impact of digital literature shows that it can play an important role in building core literacy skills; however there is an ongoing debate about whether it conveys the same benefits as reading a physical book.</p>
