<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>As one of the core subjects, English is one of the most sought after by employers and Universities. The ability to work in a globalised economy requires young people to engage in a fluent way with the printed and digital worlds. Nearly 1 in 4 teenagers in the UK have received private or home tuition at some point, according to recent IPSOS Mori research. It is a flexible way to improve both grades and confidence. Although English is at the heart of the Curriculum, many other subjects depend on high levels of fluency and technical accuracy in grammar vocabulary and punctuation.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions with detailed feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSE English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>A Level English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>The Common Entrance 11+, 13 or scholarship papers</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I offer a 20 minute free consultation (no obligation) in advance of booking lessons, to enable you to meet me, chat about your needs and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the tuition. This can happen over the phone or in person.</p>

<h4>How much do you charge for a lesson?</h4>
<p>I charge <b>£25</b> for a <b>60</b> minute lesson up to GCSE, and <b>£35</b> for A Level.</p>

<h4>How is the new English curriculum structured?</h4>
<p>English is a core subject because a secure knowledge of it helps students express their ideas and do well in other subjects which require written answers. Students who are currently in Year 9 will be the first to sit the Government’s new “closed book” exams. Grades will be replaced by numbers 1-9 (9 being the highest). Controlled assessments will disappear, consequently the exam counts for 100% of marks. Practice and exam techniques are the key to doing well. There is a renewed emphasis on spelling, punctuation and grammar. I am familiar with GCSE and A level syllabi and instruct my students how to target marking criteria in order to meet their grade aspirations.</p>

<h4>Why is reading important?</h4>
<p>Being a fluent reader is central to making academic progress at school. It is also a requirement for children who want a place at selective local private schools. Some organisations such as the National Literacy Trust and the OECD claim that reading for pleasure at the age of 15, is a strong factor in determining the future success of the child. Analysis so far of the impact of digital literature is that it can play an important role in building core literacy skills, but there is an ongoing debate about whether it conveys the same benefits as reading a physical book.</p>

<h4>How do you encourage students to learn?</h4>
<p>Students can struggle to keep up with the pace of a busy classroom and thrive more within a quiet environment of one to one tuition. Their prior attainment and knowledge is crucial so that they are working at a level that stretches them intellectually, however not so much that they are stressed by the learning opportunity. They should also be encouraged to use what they already know, as a way of helping them understand new concepts. I promote critical thinking by encouraging students to ask their own questions, to give them as much ownership of their own learning as possible. All examination boards are catered for and revision guides can be produced on request.</p>


<h4>Is learning style important?</h4>
<p>English is linked to self-esteem, confidence and optimism, as it is the core way students express themselves. The majority of learners can adapt their preferred style to a given task, but occasionally working outside one’s preferred learning style can lead to lack of motivation; one on one tuition minimises this effect.</p>

<h4>Can you do my work for me?</h4>
<p>Sadly I cannot write essays for you. Students do ask this now and again and while I like to help in any I can, writing other people’s essays is not a good idea. However I am happy to offer sessions on study skills and help make what you’ve written yourself amazing!</p>

<h4>What are “assessment objectives”?</h4>
<p>The nature of an English exam, and the fact that there are sometimes no right or wrong answers, can make studying English surprisingly challenging. There are numerous “assessment objectives” and the key to success lies in mastering the complexity of these. Exam boards like students to “read between the lines”, to do something more than extract the literal meaning from a text.</p>

<h4>How do you choose learning materials to help my child?</h4>
<p>Providing resources which “tell” students how to get a C grade or an A* is not the same as teaching them in a way which promotes the embedding of the skills needed to get these grades.</p>
<p>I use a mixture of textbooks and real world resources to help students make connections in their learning and to help them see the relevance.</p>
<p>I plan higher order questions which should engage and challenge students.</p>
<p>I choose resources which involve higher order skills such as evaluation and synthesis.</p>
<p>A broad repertoire of vocabulary will help students engage with the curriculum, so I encourage reflective reading; both by encouraging independent reading at home and showing students how to question the texts that they read.</p>
