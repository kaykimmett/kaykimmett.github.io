<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>As one of the core subjects, English is one of the most sought after by employers and Universities. The ability to work in a globalised economy requires young people to engage in a fluent way with the printed and digital worlds. Nearly 1 in 4 teenagers in the UK have received private or home tuition at some point, according to recent IPSOS Mori research. It is a flexible way to improve both grades and confidence.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targetted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one off last minute exam practice sessions.</p>


<h4>Why is reading important?</h4>
<p>Being a fluent reader is central to making academic progress at school. It is also a requirement for children who want a place at selective local private schools. Good readers tend to access other academic subjects more easily. Some general information on how to increase reading levels is included in the link.</p>

<h4>How do you encourage students to learn?</h4>
<p>Every student learns in a different way, so I strive to develop creative and innovative ways to engage with the new syllabus and students’ grade aspirations.</p>

<p>Students can struggle to keep up with the pace of a busy classroom and thrive more within a quiet envirionment of one to one tuition. Pupil’s prior attainment and knowledge is crucial so that they are working at a level that stretches them intellectually, however not so much that they are stressed by the learning opportunity. They should also be enocouraged to use what they already know as a way of helping them understand new concepts.</p>


<h4>Is learning style important?</h4>
<p>English is linked to self-esteem, confidence and optimism, as it is the core way students express themselves. The majority of learners can adapt their preferred style to a given task, but occasionally working outside one’s preferred learning style can lead to lack of motivation; one on one tuition minimises this effect.</p>

<h4>Can you do my coursework for me?</h4>
<p>Sadly I am not able to write GCSE coursework essays for you. People do ask this now and again and while I like to help in any I can writing other people’s essays is fraud! However I am happy to offer sessions on study skills and I can give a huge amount of help making what you’ve written yourself amazing.</p>

<h4>What are “assessment objectives”?</h4>
<p>The nature of an English exam and the fact that there are sometimes no right or wrong answers can make studying English surprisingly challenging. There are numerous “assessment objectives” and the key to success lies in mastering these. You in how you can solve problem.</p>
