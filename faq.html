<h4>How is the new English curriculum structured?</h4>
<p>There is no more educational division of “foundation” and “higher” tiers at GCSE. The new ethos is that unseen texts have inherent unpredictability and will include words and phrases that are unfamiliar; however students can develop the skills to unlock this knowledge. The exam boards, far from trying to throw a cloak over their new syllabi, provide lots of helpful resources and key tips online that can be used to hone the skills of critical reading and evaluation. I would advise students to fully explore their exam board’s website and consider their mark schemes.

<h4>How do you encourage students to learn?</h4>
<p>I am adamant about the need for a systematic “bite-sized” approach.  Enticing students towards older texts is not an insurmountable challenge once they realise that some topics do not date. It is not necessarily uncharted territory. Students need to prevent their instinct to “firefight” everything at once. Literary and linguistic prowess does not necessarily come naturally and making mistakes are an important element in the learning process. The methodology of deducing and inferring quickly and explaining ideas accurately under timed conditions needs practice.</p>

<h4>How do you choose learning materials?</h4>
<p>Classroom teachers care deeply about student progress, so tuition should complement ongoing work and deepen understanding of it.</p>
<p>I use a mixture of textbooks and real world resources to help students make connections in their learning and to help them see the relevance of what they are doing.</p>
<p>I plan challenging questions which should engage students.</p>

<h4>Can you do my work for me?</h4>
<p>Sadly I cannot write essays for you. Students do ask this now and again and while I like to help in any way I can, writing other people’s essays is not a good idea. However I am happy to offer sessions on study skills and help make what you’ve written yourself, amazing!</p>

<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>As well as being a core subject, English skills are valued by both employers and Universities. The ability to work in a globalised economy requires young people to engage in a fluent way with the printed and digital worlds. Nearly 1 in 4 teenagers in the UK have received private or home tuition at some point, according to recent IPSOS Mori research. It is a flexible way to improve both grades and confidence. Although English is at the heart of the curriculum, many other subjects depend on high levels of fluency and technical accuracy in grammar, vocabulary and punctuation.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance. Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions with detailed feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSE English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>A Level English Language and English Literature.</li>
<li>The Common Entrance 11+, 13 or scholarship papers</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I offer a 20 minute free consultation (no obligation) in advance of booking lessons, to enable you to meet me, chat about your needs and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the tuition. This can happen over the phone or in person.</p>

<h4>How much do you charge for a lesson?</h4>
<p>I charge <b>£25</b> for a <b>60</b> minute lesson up to GCSE, and <b>£35</b> for A Level.</p>


<h4>Why is reading important?</h4>
<p>Being a fluent reader is central to making academic progress at school. It is also a requirement for children who want a place at selective local private schools. Some organisations such as the National Literacy Trust and the OECD claim that reading for pleasure at the age of 15 is a strong factor in determining the future success of the child. Analysis so far of the impact of digital literature shows that it can play an important role in building core literacy skills; however there is an ongoing debate about whether it conveys the same benefits as reading a physical book.</p>


<h4>What are “assessment objectives”?</h4>
<p>The nature of an English exam, and the fact that there are sometimes no “right” or “wrong” answers, can make studying English surprisingly challenging. There are numerous “assessment objectives” and the key to success lies in mastering the complexity of these. Exam boards like students to “read between the lines”, to do something more than extract the literal meaning from a text.</p>
