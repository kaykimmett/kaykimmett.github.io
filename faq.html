<h4>Why is English important?</h4>
<p>As one of the core subjects, English is one of the most sought after by employers and Universities.  The ability to work in a globalised economy requires young people to engage in a fluent way with the printed and digital worlds.  Nearly 1 in 4 teenagers in the UK have received private or home tuition at some point, according to recent IPSOS Mori research.  It is a flexible way to improve both grades and confidence.</p>

<h4>What types of private tuition can you offer?</h4>
<p>I offer tuition aimed at improving general overall performance.  Additionally I offer more targeted tuition for specific weak areas or to bridge some knowledge gaps. I also offer one-off last minute exam practice sessions.with detailed feedback.</p>

<p>Tuition in GCSE English Language and English Literature.</p>
<p>Tuition for The Common Entrance  11+, 13 or scholarship papers</p>

<p>Additionally, I offer a 20 minute free consultation (no obligation) in advance of booking lessons, to enable you to meet me, chat about your needs and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the tuition.  This can happen over the phone or in person.</p>

<p>How much do you charge for a lesson?</p>
<p>I charge £25 for a 60 minute lesson.</p>

<p>How is the new English curriculum structured?</p>
<p>English is a core subject because a secure knowledge of it helps students express their ideas and do well in other subjects which require written answers.  Students who are currently in Year 9 will be the first to sit the Government’s new “closed book” exams.  Grades will be replaced by numbers 1-9 (9 being the highest).  Controlled assessments will disappear, consequently the exam counts for 100% of marks.  Practice and exam techniques are the key to doing well.  There is a renewed emphasis on spelling, punctuation and grammar.</p>

<h4>Why is reading important?</h4>
<p>Being a fluent reader is central to making academic progress at school.  It is also a requirement for children who want a place at  selective local private schools.  Some organisations such as the National Literacy Trust and the OECD claim that reading for pleasure at the age of 15, is a strong factor in determining the future  success of the child. Analysis so far of the impact of digital literature is that it can play an important role in building core literacy skills, but there is an ongoing debate about whether it conveys the same benefits as reading a physical book.</p>

<h4>How do you encourage students to learn?</h4>
<p>Every student learns in a different way, so I strive to develop creative and innovative ways to engage with the new syllabus and students’ grade aspirations.</p>

<p>Students can struggle to keep up with the pace of a busy classroom and thrive more within a quiet environment of one to one tuition.  Pupil’s prior attainment and knowledge is crucial so that they are working at a level that stretches them intellectually, however not so much that they are stressed by the learning opportunity.  They should also be encouraged to use what they already know, as a way of helping them understand new concepts.  I promote critical thinking by encouraging students to ask their own questions, to give them as much ownership of their own learning as possible.</p>


<h4>Is learning style important?</h4>
<p>English is linked to self-esteem, confidence and optimism, as it is the core way students express themselves.  The majority of learners can adapt their preferred style to a given task, but occasionally working outside one’s preferred learning style can lead to lack of motivation;  one on one tuition minimises this effect.</p>

<h4>Can you do my work for me?</h4>
<p>Sadly I cannot write essays for you.  Students do ask this now and again and while I like to help in any I can, writing other people’s essays is not a good idea.  However I am happy to offer sessions on study skills and help make what you’ve written yourself amazing!</p>

<h4>What are “assessment objectives”?</h4>
<p>The nature of an English exam, and the fact that there are sometimes no right or wrong answers, can make studying English surprisingly challenging.  There are numerous “assessment objectives” and the key to success lies in mastering the complexity of these.  Exam boards like students to “read between the lines”, to do something more than extract the literal meaning from a text.</p>
