I have taught English Language and Literature for the past 15 years in two large Outstanding state schools and a small private school. Before teaching I worked in a FTSE 100 company, a global business ………….

The ultimate aim of English is to create independent thinkers who can develop their own ideas about the world through exploratory talk and wide reading. I believe that one of the best way for students to achieve their potential, is to teach English in a positive and enthusiastic way. For many students private tuition can reinforce and energise their motivation and learning. There is a clear connection between being truly imaginative, and self belief so I hope not just to avoid giving generalised advice, but to make the advice that I do give easier to remember than a list of dos and don’ts. Providing reasons allows students to apply clear guidelines judiciously, mindful of what they are designed to accomplish. 

As a tutor, emotional support as well as academic enables students to find the root of problems and helps them work through them quietly and slowly. Ultimately, I am very non-judgemental and always want students to be able to feel confident enough to take risks, experiment and make mistakes. Every student learns in a different way, so creative and innovative ways to engage each individual student is always a high priority; there are few standardised models for learning.

If students wish to take their learning to a high level in this subject, it helps if they find the process enjoyable and engaging, as well as putting in the hours. I strive to make the work itself interesting, so that students will feel comfortable asking questions and understanding that mistakes are actually a critical part of the learning process. The job of a great tutor is to find the best way to encourage, challenge and ultimately to inspire their students.
