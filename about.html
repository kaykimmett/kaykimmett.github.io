<img class="headshot" src="/assets/kay-kimmett-square.jpg"><p>Before teaching, I was based in London working in PR for a FTSE 100 company. This involved writing skills and monitoring the company’s press coverage. Since moving to leafy Hampshire I have enjoyed 16 years experience teaching English in two Hampshire “Outstanding” Secondary schools and in a small private school. Spending too much time in cars, planes and trains is a not a plus though. I have family in Belfast, my husband is Scottish and one son lives in the USA. My iPad and Kindle travel with me, generally with my guilty pleasures a good crime novel or drama production.</p>
