<img class="headshot" src="/assets/kay-kimmett.jpg"><p>I have enjoyed 15 years hands  on experience teaching English in two Large Outstanding Secondary schools and in a small private school. My children are grown up so I devote free time to stand up comedy, live music, theatre and travel.</p> 

<p>Originally I am from Northern Ireland and in my pre-teaching career worked for a FTSE 100 company in parliamentary affairs – a very different environment to energetic teens! Don’t hesitate to get to in touch for a chat if you think I could help your child.</p>
