<img class="headshot" src="/assets/kay-kimmett-square.jpg"><p>I am a voracious reader; timeless texts from Sterne, Yeats and Austen are amongst my favourites, but I also have a weakness for crime novels. Regular visits to the theatre and music venues locally are essential – sporadic visits do not work for me!</p>

<p>I have often been wary of the benefits of computers but having two very techie children has convinced me of the professional and personal benefits and I am on the way to becoming an evangelical myself! Thanks to the internet there are lots of helpful resources universally available to students and teachers alike. I try to keep fit with a little pilates and am an enthusiastic (but limited) gardener.  I have enjoyed 15 years experience teaching English in two Hampshire “Outstanding” Secondary schools and in a small private school.</p>
