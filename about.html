<img class="headshot" src="/assets/kay-kimmett-square.jpg"><p>I have enjoyed 15 years hands  on experience teaching English in two large Outstanding Secondary schools and in a small private school. I have two grown up childen and I devote free time to stand up comedy, live music, theatre and travel…and of course voracious reading!</p>

<p>I grew up in Northern Ireland and in my pre-teaching career worked for a London-based FTSE 100 company in parliamentary affairs – a very different environment to energetic teens! Don’t hesitate to get in touch for a chat if you think I can help your child.</p>
