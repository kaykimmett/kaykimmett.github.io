  <h2>Types of tuition</h2>
  <h3>Weekly tuition</h3>
  <p>This regular one to one tuition is a supplement to a student’s schooling and helps understanding of the subject. It can compensate for insufficient individual attention, difficulty in grasping concepts, or poor motivation. A relaxed but workmanlike atmosphere helps build student confidence away from a busy classroom.</p>

  <h3>Weekly grade booster</h3>
  <p>This is useful before external examinations, mock or formal exams.</p>
